## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using a variety of machine learning algorithms. Accurate price predictions can greatly benefit buyers, sellers, and real estate agents.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. The following steps are performed:
- Removal of duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns and insights. Key steps include:
- Distribution analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Visualizations

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features that can improve model performance. Steps include:
- Location-based features
- Age of the house
- Interaction features
- Aggregation features

## Modeling

Various machine learning models are implemented and compared, including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

## Evaluation

Models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Cross-validation is used to ensure robustness.

## Results

The results section highlights the performance of different models and identifies the best-performing model. Visualizations of model predictions and actual house prices are included.

## Conclusions

This section summarizes the key findings, discusses the implications, and suggests potential improvements for future work.
